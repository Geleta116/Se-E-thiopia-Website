This is the repositoray I will use to submit my website development course assignments
The title of the WEBSITE is se-E-thiopia which is a websites that tries to depict the cultural and traditional aspect of Ethiopia ranging from traditional clothes to Historical Sites. 

The reason why it doesn't have a login and a sign up page is because the purpose of the website is not for the user to create any accounts but just to go the website and learn more about Ethiopia.
