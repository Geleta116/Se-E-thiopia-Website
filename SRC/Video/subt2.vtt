00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.150
Website.

2
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.330
Maybe you're thinking about having your first
one made or maybe you just need a new, better

3
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.330
one.

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.470
In any case, you should know at least some
of the basics about web design.

5
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.570
No worries, it will only take three minutes.

6
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.860
First of all, let's face it.

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.079
A website is the core of your online marketing
activities.

8
00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.930
If you look at all the marketing channels
and techniques, what they actually do is bring

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.870
visitors to your website.

10
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.020
The main purpose of a website is turning these
visitors into customers.

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.570
In marketing terms, this is called conversion.

12
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.230
A bad website will basically cause you to
waste money on other marketing methods because

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.220
you don't need more visitors if you can't
turn them into customers.

14
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.579
The better your website is, the more visitors
are converted into your customers.

15
00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.399
It doesn't really matter whether you sell
consumer products online, provide local services,

16
00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.329
or build houses.

17
00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.790
Many people in the industry call themselves
web designers but they really are just a bunch

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450
of geeks with some basic coding knowledge.

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.070
Of course without much planning, they will
pretty quickly create a website for you with

20
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.189
lots of information, photos, contacts, but
the question is, is that the way to turn your

21
00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.990
visitors into your customers?

22
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.469
Is that what you need?

23
00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.319
The answer is simple: No!

24
00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.619
What you have to do is look for someone serious
about web design.

25
00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.659
Well, that's where we come in.

26
00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.010
This is how we make websites, by following
this 7-phase web design process.

27
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.770
Phase 1: Analysis.

28
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.219
The first step is always about information
gathering, identifying things like the website

29
00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.159
purpose, goals, and target audience.

30
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.249
Phase 2: Planning.

31
00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:50.099
A plan includes a definition of the site map,
structure, and technologies that we're about

32
00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:51.349
to use.

33
00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:52.399
Phase 3: Design.

34
00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.729
Not only do we focus on wireframe models and
the visual style in this stage, but also on

35
00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.340
the usability of the user interface for the
best possible user experience.

36
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.669
Phase 4: Content.

37
00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:09.729
A very important part of the process is choosing
the right text, photos, or videos, all optimized

38
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.990
not only for your visitors but also for search
engines.

39
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.090
Phase 5: Development.

40
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.610
Here we actually create the website using
the hypertext markup language and cascading

41
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.870
style sheets with some help from databases
and other technologies as well.

42
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.900
If needed, our websites can be made accessible
to mobile devices too.

43
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.970
Phase 6: Testing.

44
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.530
We test all the technical features like code
and scripts, compatibility with major browsers,

45
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.250
but we also ask ourselves if the website really
fulfills its purpose.

46
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.420
Phase 7: Deployment.

47
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.320
After we launch the site, our job is definitely
not done yet.

48
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.560
We always monitor what's happening after the
start, enabling us to fix any possible deficiencies

49
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.450
and if you want, we can also manage the future
maintenance and updates for you.

50
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.540
As you have just seen, web design is a very
complex process but we believe this is how

51
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.830
websites should be done and our customers
agree.

52
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.940

websites, let's get in touch.

best.
